Description: caching algorithms in httplib2 for use with requests
 CacheControl is a port of the caching algorithms in httplib2 for use with
 requests session object.
 .
 It was written because httplib2's better support for caching is often
 mitigated by its lack of threadsafety. The same is true of requests in
 terms of caching.
 .
 This is the Python 3 library.
